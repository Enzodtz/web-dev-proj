          Before 1983, navigating the internet was a challenging and confusing
          task. Users had to memorize long, complex IP addresses to reach
          websites, which made the internet less accessible and user-friendly.
          The introduction of the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983 fundamentally
          changed the way the internet functioned, making it easier to access
          and navigate. By mapping human-readable domain names (such as
          www.example.com) to numerical IP addresses (such as 192.168.1.1), DNS
          made the internet more intuitive and scalable.

    <h2>Why DNS?</h2>
    <p>
      Before DNS, the process of navigating the internet was far more complex.
      Users had to rely on a file called hosts.txt, which manually listed domain
      names and their corresponding IP addresses. This file was sufficient for a
      small network of computers, but as the internet began to grow
      exponentially, the hosts.txt system became unmanageable. DNS removed the
      need for a single central list and allowing the internet to expand rapidly
      while remaining user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creation of DNS revolutionized the way people accessed the internet.
      For the first time, businesses, universities, and individuals could set up
      websites and be easily located using a simple domain name. DNS opened up
      the web to anyone, allowing more people to use and navigate the internet
      without needing technical knowledge about IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the internet expanded, so did the number of domain names. The
      introduction of top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, and .net
      further streamlined the process of finding websites. DNS not only made
      websites easier to find, but it also helped create a standardized system
      for identifying websites across the globe.
    </p>
    <h2>How DNS Works:</h2>
    <p>
      DNS operates through a network of servers that communicate with each other
      to resolve domain names. When you type a website address into your
      browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS resolver, which searches
      for the IP address associated with that domain name. If the resolver does
      not have the information cached, it queries other DNS servers, eventually
      finding the IP address and returning it to your browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your browser receives the correct IP address, it can connect to the
      web server hosting the site, allowing the page to load. This entire
      process typically takes only a fraction of a second, making it nearly
      invisible to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      How DNS Supports the Modern Internet Without DNS, the internet would not
      be as accessible or navigable as it is today. It is the backbone of
      internet navigation, enabling users to access websites, send emails, and
      use web-based applications without needing to understand the technical
      details of how the internet functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the internet continues to grow, DNS remains an essential component of
      its infrastructure. Today, there are billions of domain names and IP
      addresses that must be efficiently mapped and resolved by DNS servers.
      These systems ensure the smooth operation of the global internet,
      providing reliability and speed for users worldwide.
