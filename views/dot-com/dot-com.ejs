  <h1 class="title-2">2000 - The dot-com boom</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      In the mid-1990s, the internet was no longer just a tool for academics or
      researchers; it was becoming an essential part of everyday life. This
      period saw the emergence of commercial websites and the widespread
      adoption of the .com domain as businesses and individuals alike began to
      recognize the internet’s potential for commerce, communication, and global
      reach. The .com domain, initially used as a designation for commercial
      entities, became a symbol of the internet’s transformation from an
      academic tool to a global marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the UK, this was a pivotal moment. The commercialization of the
      internet had far-reaching implications for businesses, consumers, and the
      broader economy. As the World Wide Web grew, the UK began to embrace this
      new digital frontier, with businesses racing to secure their online
      presence using .com domains.
    </p>
    <h2>The Emergence of the .com</h2>
    <p>
      The .com top-level domain (TLD) was created in 1985 as part of the initial
      Domain Name System (DNS). It was originally designed to signify commercial
      entities, and the first few years saw its use by corporations and
      organizations with an interest in conducting business online. However, it
      wasn’t until the early-to-mid-1990s that the .com domain truly exploded in
      popularity, especially in the UK, as the internet rapidly commercialized.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1995, businesses in the UK were beginning to recognize the importance
      of establishing an online presence. Dot-com websites became essential for
      companies seeking to capitalize on the growing global audience of internet
      users. This new virtual marketplace opened up opportunities for businesses
      of all sizes to interact with customers, offer services, and create brand
      visibility on a global scale.
    </p>
    <h2>UK Businesses and the Adoption of the .com Domain</h2>
    <p>
      In the UK, the rise of .com domains mirrored global trends, with an
      increasing number of businesses quickly adopting this new domain to
      establish their digital presence. The .com domain became a mark of
      legitimacy, signaling to consumers that a business was up-to-date with the
      times and ready to embrace the digital age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mid-1990s saw major UK companies, including some of the nation’s
      retail giants, launching their websites under the .com domain. These
      included The Body Shop, Marks & Spencer, and British Airways, each of
      which established an online presence as part of their broader digital
      transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many UK businesses, securing a .com domain was a sign of
      forward-thinking and adaptability. It also helped businesses expand their
      reach beyond the local or national market to a global audience,
      effectively opening up new revenue streams and ways to connect with
      customers. With the .com domain dominating the online space, UK businesses
      had the opportunity to compete on the global stage.
    </p>
    <h2>The Race to Claim a Domain</h2>
    <p>
      As the internet began to grow exponentially, securing a .com domain became
      an increasingly competitive endeavor. During the dot-com boom of the late
      1990s, companies and entrepreneurs scrambled to create new websites, many
      of which were registered under the .com extension. With the rapid growth
      of the internet, the demand for domain names surged, and acquiring a
      catchy, memorable, and available .com domain became an important part of a
      business's digital strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some companies in the UK, the rush to secure a .com domain led to the
      creation of new internet-based businesses that focused purely on online
      services and e-commerce. Businesses like Lastminute.com and boo.com, both
      founded in the UK in the late 1990s, capitalized on the growing interest
      in online shopping and travel services. These companies used the .com
      domain to signify their digital-first business model, which allowed them
      to tap into the booming e-commerce market and the rising global internet
      audience.
    </p>
    <h2>Consumer relation</h2>
    <p>
      For consumers in the UK, the rise of .com domains marked a significant
      shift in how people accessed products, services, and information. While
      the early internet was primarily used for information sharing, the .com
      revolution brought the internet to the forefront of consumer life.
      Websites with the .com domain became the go-to places for people to shop,
      learn, communicate, and entertain themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The growing trust in .com websites helped facilitate the rise of online
      shopping, where UK consumers could purchase anything from books to
      electronics with just a few clicks. Amazon, one of the most well-known
      .com companies in the world, started to gain traction globally, including
      in the UK. The .com domain became synonymous with e-commerce, offering UK
      customers the convenience of shopping from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside e-commerce, the .com domain also paved the way for online
      banking, travel bookings, and news services. Websites like Tesco.com and
      BBC.com became key players in the UK’s digital landscape, helping
      consumers navigate the growing world of online services.
    </p>
    <h2>The Dot-Com Bubble</h2>
    <p>
      The rapid growth of businesses using the .com domain during the late 1990s
      culminated in the dot-com bubble - a period of intense speculation around
      the value of internet-based companies. Investors poured billions of
      dollars into dot-com companies with little regard for their actual
      profitability, driven by the belief that the internet would soon be a
      dominant force in the global economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many UK companies participated in this boom, but when the bubble burst in
      2000, the dot-com crash led to the downfall of numerous internet startups.
      Companies like boo.com (which had been one of the UK’s most ambitious
      online fashion retailers) and Lastminute.com were hit hard by the crash.
      Despite the downturn, the .com domain had already firmly established
      itself as the dominant web address for businesses and individuals alike.
