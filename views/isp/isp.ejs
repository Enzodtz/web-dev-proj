  <h1 class="title">1995 - The first ISPs</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      By 1995, the internet was becoming more than just a tool for research
      institutions and academic circles. The public in the UK was starting to
      experience the internet in their homes, largely due to the rise of
      Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This year marked a turning point, as
      commercial internet access became widely available and people could
      connect to the internet from their homes. As a result, the UK saw a surge
      in internet usage, setting the stage for the future digital age.
    </p>
    <h2>The Emergence of ISPs in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      In 1995, Demon Internet was one of the pioneering companies in the UK,
      providing dial-up internet access to the general public. Founded in 1992,
      Demon Internet became one of the first ISPs to offer affordable internet
      services for home use, allowing users to connect to the web through their
      phone lines. The popularity of Demon Internet, alongside other ISPs such
      as BT Internet, Freeserve, and Plusnet, quickly began to transform the
      internet from a niche tool into a household utility.

    <p>
      These early ISPs played a crucial role in the internet's mass adoption.
      They provided essential services such as web hosting, email accounts, and
      easy-to-use dial-up connections. These services allowed everyday people,
      businesses, and even schools to access the internet for the first time,
      vastly expanding the user base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demon Internet, in particular, was instrumental in popularizing internet
      usage in the UK. The company’s easy-to-navigate service and reasonable
      pricing plans made the internet more accessible to individuals who were
      otherwise unfamiliar with the technology. In the years that followed,
      Demon Internet would become synonymous with the internet revolution in the
      UK, alongside the many other ISPs that followed in its footsteps.

    <h2>Dial-Up Connections</h2>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
          In 1995, most users still accessed the internet via dial-up
          connections, which involved connecting to the web through a standard
          phone line. Dial-up internet, while relatively slow compared to
          today’s broadband connections, was revolutionary at the time. Users
          would connect to their ISP by dialing a special phone number, which
          would allow their computers to establish an internet connection.

    <p>
      Dial-up internet was inexpensive and easy to install, making it a popular
      choice for home users. The ability to send and receive emails, browse
      early web pages, and even explore newsgroups created an entirely new way
      for people to communicate and share information. The development of simple
      web browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer also played a
      significant role in making the internet more user-friendly for the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, dial-up connections had some limitations. The internet connection
      was often slow, taking several minutes to load websites, and users could
      not use the phone line to make calls while online. Despite these
      drawbacks, dial-up internet became the gateway for millions of people to
      discover the world of online content, from basic websites to online
      communities.
    </p>
    <h2>The Rise in Internet Usage in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      As more ISPs appeared on the scene, internet usage in the UK grew
      exponentially. By the mid-1990s, the number of people using the internet
      had skyrocketed, and the internet was no longer limited to academic and
      research environments. The UK saw millions of new users coming online,
      eager to explore the web, check their emails, and discover the vast array
      of content available.

    <p>
      The rise of ISPs like Freeserve, which was launched in 1998 and later
      became one of the largest UK ISPs, contributed to the rapid expansion of
      internet access. Services offered by these ISPs were marketed through
      television and radio advertisements, reaching a wide audience and making
      the internet a mainstream product for the average consumer. The number of
      internet users in the UK grew dramatically throughout the 1990s, paving
      the way for the digital revolution that would follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This period also saw the beginning of the rise of online communities,
      where users could communicate with each other through bulletin boards,
      chat rooms, and newsgroups. These early online communities were a
      precursor to the social networks and forums that would dominate the
      internet in the years to come.
    </p>
    <h2>Technological Developments</h2>
    <p>
      The growth of internet access was supported by several key technological
      developments. One of the most significant was the improvement in telephone
      lines and modem speeds, which made internet connections more reliable and
      faster. Companies like BT and Cable & Wireless played important roles in
      expanding the UK’s telecom infrastructure, which allowed users in even
      remote areas to access the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of early web browsers, such as Mosaic (released in 1993)
      and later Internet Explorer (released in 1995), also contributed to the
      internet’s accessibility. These browsers allowed users to view web pages
      and navigate the growing number of websites with ease. For the first time,
      the internet was accessible to people who weren’t familiar with the
      complex code behind it.
    </p>
    <h2>Home Usage</h2>
    <p>
      By 1995, more households in the UK were beginning to get internet
      connections, often as part of bundled packages from their ISPs. The home
      computer became a common tool for accessing the web, and the internet
      began to be viewed as an essential resource for work, communication, and
      entertainment. Families and individuals were now able to communicate via
      email, search for information, and access news and entertainment all from
      the comfort of their own homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the internet grew in popularity, many ISPs adapted to this new demand
      by offering more affordable plans, better customer support, and faster
      connections. This increasing accessibility helped solidify the internet as
      an essential part of everyday life in the UK.
