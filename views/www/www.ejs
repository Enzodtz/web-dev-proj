  <h1 class="title-2">1989 - The World Wide Web</h1>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      In 1989, a groundbreaking idea was proposed by British computer scientist
      Tim Berners-Lee at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research).
      This idea would eventually become the World Wide Web (WWW), a system that
      transformed the internet from a network used by researchers into a global
      space accessible to billions. With the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee
      revolutionized how information was shared and accessed, creating the
      foundation for the internet we use today.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a time when the internet was primarily used by researchers for
      exchanging data and messages, Berners-Lee proposed a way to enable a more
      dynamic, interconnected world. His system would allow people to access
      information, navigate between documents using hyperlinks, and easily share
      content across a global network. The introduction of the World Wide Web
      marked a moment that would fundamentally change how humans interact with
      the digital world.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the World Wide Web?</h2>

    <p>
      The World Wide Web is a system for accessing and sharing information
      across the internet using hyperlinks. Berners-Leeâ€™s vision was to create a
      global information space where documents could be linked together,
      allowing users to navigate from one document to another simply by clicking
      on hyperlinks. This idea of interconnected documents laid the groundwork
      for the development of web browsers, web pages, and the expansive digital
      ecosystem that would follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the World Wide Web, the internet existed mainly as a tool for
      scientific and academic communication. The Web made this information
      accessible to the general public, offering an easy-to-navigate platform
      that allowed individuals to discover and share information. It was a
      breakthrough in how we engage with data, offering a simple yet powerful
      means of accessing information online.
    </p>

    <h2>The Key Technologies Behind the Web</h2>

    <p>
      To bring the World Wide Web to life, Berners-Lee developed several key
      technologies:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b>: A coding language used to
        create and format web pages, which would display text, images, and
        multimedia content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</b>: A protocol that governs how
        web browsers and web servers communicate with each other to deliver
        content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Web Browsers</b>: Software tools that allow users to view and
        interact with web pages. These browsers would become the primary
        interface through which people navigated the Web.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition to developing these technologies, Berners-Lee created the
      first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, and developed the first website,
      hosted on a server at CERN, which explained how the Web worked and how
      others could use it. This set the stage for the Web to expand, bringing
      the internet to millions of people worldwide.

    <h2>The First Website</h2>
    <p>
      In 1991, Berners-Lee launched the first-ever website at CERN:
      info.cern.ch. This website was a simple, text-based page that explained
      the basics of the World Wide Web, how it functioned, and how people could
      create their own websites. This site was the beginning of the World Wide
      Web, and although basic by today's standards, it laid the groundwork for
      the exponential growth that would follow in the years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first website was mainly informational, and its purpose was to help
      others understand the potential of the Web. It served as a guide for
      researchers, academics, and others interested in using this new,
      innovative system to share and access data. Over time, websites would grow
      to become more dynamic, interactive, and visually rich, reflecting the
      incredible potential of the World Wide Web.

    <h2>The Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The introduction of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s quickly gained
      momentum. It turned the internet into a place where people could not only
      access academic and research materials but also share personal ideas,
      businesses, news, and entertainment. The World Wide Web democratized
      access to information, making the internet a powerful tool for
      communication and knowledge-sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web also played a major role in the rise of e-commerce, social media,
      and search engines-sectors that would become pillars of the modern
      internet economy. The development of web browsers, which made it easy to
      browse websites, and the creation of search engines that indexed this vast
      new source of data, further accelerated the adoption of the Web by the
      general public. Within just a few years, millions of websites sprang up,
      transforming the internet into a global platform for both individuals and
      businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commercialization of the internet followed shortly after the advent of
      the World Wide Web, giving rise to an entirely new global marketplace.
      With websites like Amazon and eBay launching in the mid-1990s, e-commerce
      became a reality, and businesses realized the vast potential of the
      internet for reaching global audiences.
